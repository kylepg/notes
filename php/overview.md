# PHP

## PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor

PHP is a scripting language designed for the web (but isn't exclusive to the web).

Technically, PHP falls under the umbrella of a scripting language because it is processed by an interpreter, as opposed to a programming language which is executed by a compiler.

In other words, PHP is interpreted, not compiled.

The servers we'll use in this course contain a server module that handles the interpreting.
