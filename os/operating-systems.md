# UNIX vs Linux

- UNIX is a registered trade mark of The Open Group. The trade mark has had an eventful history, and it's not completely clear that it's not genericized due to the widespread usage of “Unix” refering to Unix-like systems (see below). Currently the Open Group grants use of the trade mark to any system that passes a Single UNIX certification. See also Why is there a * When There is Mention of Unix Throughout the Internet?.

- Unix is an operating system that was born in 1969 at Bell Labs. Various companies sold, and still sell, code derived from this original system, for example AIX, HP-UX, Solaris. See also Evolution of Operating systems from Unix.

- There are many systems that are Unix-like, in that they offer similar interfaces to programmers, users and administrators. The oldest production system is the Berkeley Software Distribution, which gradually evolved from Unix-based (i.e. containing code derived from the original implementation) to Unix-like (i.e. having a similar interface). There are many BSD-based or BSD-derived operating systems: FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, etc. Other examples include OSF/1 (now discontinued, it was a commercial Unix-like non-Unix-based system), Minix (originally a toy Unix-like operating system used as a teaching tool, now a production embedded Unix-like system), and most famously Linux.

- Strictly speaking, Linux is an operating system kernel that is designed like Unix's kernel.

- Linux is most commonly used as a name of Unix-like operating systems that use Linux as their kernel. As many of the tools outside the kernel are part of the GNU project, such systems are often known as GNU/Linux. All major Linux distributions consist of GNU/Linux and other software.

- There are Linux-based Unix-like systems that don't use many GNU tools, especially in the embedded world, but I don't think any of them does away with GNU development tools, in particular GCC.

- There are operating systems that have Linux as their kernel but are not Unix-like. The most well-known is Android, which doesn't have a Unix-like user experience (though you can install a Unix-like command line) or administrator experience or (mostly) programmer experience (“native” Android programs use an API that is completely different from Unix).

Unix, originally UNICS (UNiplexed Infomation and Computing Service).

Unix (trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix. Development started in 1969 and announced outside Bell abs in October 1973.

Variety of both academic and commercial variants of Unix from vendors such as the University of California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), IBM (AIX) and Sun Microsystems (Solaris).

BSD(Berkeley Software Distribution) releases provided a basis for several open source development projects that are ongoing, e.g., FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Darwin, and TrueOS.
Xenix is a discontinued version of the Unix operating system for various microcomputer platforms, licensed by Microsoft.
AIX(Advanced Interactive eXecutive) developed and sold by IBM for several of its computer platforms.
Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds.

Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. Some of the most popular and mainstream Linux distributions are Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo Linux, Linux Mint, Mageia, openSUSE and Ubuntu, together with commercial distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux

The user interface, also known as the shell, is either a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, although the CLI is commonly available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console.

CLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell (bash), originally developed for the GNU project.
GUI shells are K Desktop Environment (KDE), GNOME, MATE, Cinnamon, Unity, LXDE, Pantheon and Xfce, though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the X Window System, often simply called "X".
GNU is an operating system and an extensive collection of computer software. GNU is composed wholly of free software most of which is licensed under the GNU Project's own GPL. GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!", chosen because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and containing no Unix code. Development of the GNU operating system was initiated by Richard Stallman while he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1983.

Basic components include the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the GNU C library (glibc), and GNU Core Utilities (coreutils), but also the GNU Debugger (GDB), GNU Binary Utilities (binutils), the GNU Bash shell and the GNOME desktop environment.

## Linux OS

Linux is an OS which is named after the kernel it uses.

Most gadgets that you can think of except your laptop or PC run on some Linux distro. Linux is an open source operating system based on Unix. Linux is basically the name of the Kernel and was developed in 1991. The Linux kernel is developed by the community and Linus Torvalds oversees things. In addition to the command line interface, Linux has a graphical user interface like Windows operating system and applications to make it a complete operating system.

The Linux OS has both Graphical User Interface (GUI) as well as Command Line Interface (CLI). Linux comes with KDE and Gnome as its GUI environment. The Command Line Interface is optional in Linux.
